This project is just an ascii version of battleship. It is meant to be played by two different people on a local computer.

this is the code that places the boats
for (int count = 0; count < 3; count++){
				
				player2boats[workingY][workingX] = " X ";
				
				if (workingX == finalX){
					workingY++;
				}
				 
				else if (workingY == finalY) {
					workingX++;
				}
        
       
my motivation for creating this is i thought it would be pretty cool if i was able to do it and it was

a couple of notes: you must always have the number before the letter, and have a space between them.
read the instructions carefully, cause if you type things wrong it might skip important things.
you must start with the uppermost or leftmost coordinate first. the boat placement system doesnt work the other way
wait for the screen to clear before handing the computer to your opponent.
